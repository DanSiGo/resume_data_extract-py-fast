\\nState\\nEnterprise Resource Planning Office (ERO)\\nIn this position as an Accountant assigned to the Defense Enterprise Accounting and Management System (DEAMS) ERO I was\\nresponsible for identifying and resolving issues affecting the DEAMS General Ledger.\\nI worked with teammates from the Procure to Pay, Orders to Cash, and Budget to Report areas to resolve daily challenges encountered\\nwith the deployment of DEAMS to additional customers and when system change requests were promoted to production.\\nI supported the testing of scripts, patches, and system change requests ensuring any anomalies were identified to the DEAMS Functional\\nManagement Office for action by the DEAMS Program Management Office and/or the System Integrator.\\nIn addition, I served on a tiger team designed to identify and resolve General Ledger posting differences and supported the development of\\n$360B in accounting adjustments allowing for the first successful fiscal year-end close in 2012.\\nThese actions also allowed for the reconciliation and closure of fiscal year 2010 and 2011 accounting adjustments ensuring that all DEAMS\\nfiscal year-end requirements were completed.\\nThese actions were recognized as critical to the successful review report issued by the Air Force Operational Test and Evaluation Center\\n(AFOTEC) resulting in the Air Force receiving the authority to continue with the deployment of DEAMS.\\nCompany Name\\n \\nApril 2010\\n \\nto \\nJune 2011\\n \\nResource Advisor\\n \\nCity\\n \\n, \\nState\\nIn this position as Resource Advisor for the 1st Air Communications Operation Squadron (1ACOS) I was responsible for providing\\nfinancial advice and decision support to the Commander.\\nI was responsible for coordinating a $4.6M budget between four funding sources.\\nI coordinated with USAFE Directorate of Intelligence (USAFE/A2), USAFE Directorate of Air and Space Operations (USAFE/A3),\\nUSAFE Directorate of Communications (USAFE/A6) and the 435th Air Ground Operations Wing to ensure 1ACOS meets its mission\\nrequirements.\\nI consistently managed three separate timelines for providing budget/unfunded requirements, providing documentation and various reports in\\nthe required format for each organization.\\nI discussed the outcome of the Group and Directorate budget meetings providing feedback the same day to the Flight Chiefs and CC any\\nissue which affects 1ACOS directly.\\nI monitored the Defense Travel System (DTS) daily and identify orders and authorizations needing approval and provided notification to the\\nappropriate Reviewing Officials and Approvers.\\nUtilizing DTS and the General Accounting and Finance System I reviewed status reports to identify anomalies in obligations and have\\nidentified those orders which require correction prior to payment.\\nI provided Government Purchase Card (GPC) status reports the same day they are requested and in addition, communicated with the\\nappropriate cardholders when changes were required to support their program.\\nI identified cardholder training requirements and monitored these requirements to ensure all required training was completed in support of\\nthis mission critical program.\\nI developed guidance for the GPC cardholders on procedures for requesting training for the squadron and in addition I provided answers to\\ncardholder questions on unique or non-standard issues/concerns.Assumed the role of the Billing Official during my final rating period and completed a self inspection of the program for the Management\\nControl Program, zero findings.\\nDuring yearly audit by 700th CONS received zero findings.\\nCompany Name\\n \\nJuly 2008\\n \\nto \\nApril 2010\\n \\nStaff Accountant\\n \\nCity\\n \\n, \\nState\\nIn my position as the Staff Accountant for HQ USAFE I was responsible for providing accounting and financial oversight and advice to\\ncustomers throughout the Command in support of the USAFE Comptroller.\\nI was responsible for performing ongoing analysis of financial programs to identify negative trends and weaknesses, ensured specific\\nweaknesses were corrected, and determined whether systemic or repeat issues were identified and adequately addressed.\\nI was required to apply a comprehensive knowledge of analysis/reporting requirements and data produced to resolve these issues.\\nIn collaboration with DFAS Europe, developed an automated tool that identifies duplicate obligations by comparing records in the\\naccounting system to the contracting system and provided notification to the funds manager for review and resolution.\\nThis tool eliminated hours of manual research and results allowed HQ USAFE to deobligate over $5M in duplicate obligations.\\nI was responsible for establishing various performance metrics which ensured effective and efficient use of USAFE financial resources.\\nI supported the USAFE/FMA Financial metrics program by collaborating with DFAS Limestone in the development of an automated tool\\nthat provided senior leaders with visibility to any USAFE unit that is not in compliance with the established rules and regulations related to\\nthe GPC.\\nThis tool provides management reports that are used to populate the monthly metric charts which are briefed by the USAFE/FMA.\\nThis tool provided the capability for USAFE/FMA to collaborate with USAFE Contracting and develop/deploy joint guidance that supports\\nthe established Air Force Instruction mandating card suspension for card holders who are not in compliance with required reservation of\\nfunds in the entitlement system in support of the GPC.\\nI identified and resolved a problem with five GPC accounts that had been rejecting during the automated interface process each month.\\nMy research revealed that these accounts were rejecting for invalid paying station and required manual intervention by both Wing and\\nDFAS personnel.\\nThis not only created rework, it delayed the payment of the invoices.\\nI partnered with DFAS Denver, corrected the records in the Access On-Line accounts eliminating the error condition.\\nI identified a method to deliver one-on-one training in support of the USAFE deployment of the Open Document Analysis (ODA) tool in\\nFMSuite.\\nBy utilizing Defense Connect Online I \\nprovided training remotely, virtually eliminating the need to expend funds on Temporary Duty (TDY)\\ntravel.\\nThe results of this training produced results that went well above expectations and were noted by the ODA Program Management Office.\\nCompany Name\\n \\nJanuary 2007\\n \\nto \\nJuly 2009\\n \\nChief, Reports Branch.

monitored errors in the General Accounting and Finance System (GAFS/BQ) and ensured corrective actions were\\naccomplished.\\nI also ensured fund balances were reconciled and reports were verified prior to release to base activities and higher headquarters.\\nLimestone reorganized under the High Performing Organization (HPO) in January 2007 and at that time I was reassigned to AM&C, a\\nDirectorate which previously did not exist.\\nMy challenge during that time was to staff my branch, implement an aggressive training schedule, and ensure the continuity of financial\\nreporting was maintained.\\nAs we transitioned into the HPO we continued defining the missions and functions for AM&C for the entire network.\\nI participated in biweekly conference calls with Standards and Compliance in an effort to define missions and functions for AM&C.\\nWorked with management in determining FTEs needed for the branch.\\nI was responsible for developing meaningful performance

reconciliations from $6.9 million in February 2007 to $1.1 million in August, accomplished this despite loss in\\nexperienced personnel and realigning resources to support critical initiatives in Accounts Payable.\\nI orchestrated the transition of reporting requirements for the Transportation Financial Management System (TFMS) workload from DFAS\\nOmaha to Limestone.\\nAfter transition to

shifting priorities.\\nThis was \\nextremely important during the DFAS Denver directed database consolidations and with the assumption of the Air National Guard\\nworkload.\\nWorkload increased rapidly while staffing increased gradually, which dictated frequent priority changes and personnel moves.\\nI also worked closely with the Major Commands supported by DFAS Limestone strengthening our partnership when workload spikes\\nnegatively impacted our customers.\\nIn December 2004, our overaged invoice percentage was nearing 25% and we had a backlog of vendor pay documents exceeding 30,000.\\nBy working with the DFAS Command Client Executives and the Major Command Comptrollers, I was instrumental in forming a strategy\\nthat included soliciting Air Force personnel assistance in document processing, identification of \"must pay now\" bills, and the formation of\\nspecial action response teams dedicated to responding to our customer\\'s most urgent requirements.\\nAs a result

by DFAS and Air\\nForce personnel.\\nI was responsible for the budget resources necessary to operate the branch.\\nIn this capacity, I prepared budget over execution justifications, plan and monitor overtime costs, and control supply purchases to ensure the\\nmost cost efficient operation possible.\\nI was required to respond to inquiries from various sources, which include, but are not limited
